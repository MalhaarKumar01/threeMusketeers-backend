Sprint Goal: 
The sprint goal for sprint 1 is to complete a rough draft/rough code of all the stories that were highlighted in sprint0 documents. This will allow us to further debug our code in sprint2 and ensure that our code is as efficient as possible. Along with this we will be able to make sure that no code is overlapping in sprint2 going along with our efficient code goal. 

Stories for Sprint1: 
The following stories have been implemented in sprint1:
1.1 - Switch Sides
1.2 - Learners Mode
1.3 - Multiple Rounds
1.4 - Go Back i Moves
1.5 - Restart Game
1.6 - Probability of Winning

Assessment of Team Capacity: 
The tasks that we aim to complete over this sprint include the setup of the stories listed
above. We also are aiming to complete the implementation for all of these stories. 
We believe that there should be no major changes to our design patterns or implementations
From what we have planned for, so this will allow for smooth coding. 

Participants in Sprint: 
Aleksandra Kalas - Implemented multiple rounds feature, updated documentation for. 
productBacklog and designPatterns, note taker for SR1 and sprint1.md. 
Dhir Shukla - Implemented switch sides feature, and restart game feature. 
Jovana Spasojevic - Implemented probability of winning feature. 
Malhaar Kumar - Implemented learning mode feature and move back i moves.


Task Breakdown:
All the documentation was properly updated and corrected. The designPatterns document had some minor tweaks to things like wording along with some UML diagrams being slightly modified.
The following user stories were completed from the sprint1 productBacklog csv: User Story 1.1, 
User Story 1.2, User Story 1.3, User Story 1.4, User Story 1.5,  and User Story 1.6.
