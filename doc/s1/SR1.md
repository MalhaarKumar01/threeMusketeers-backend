Sprint Retrospective Meeting for Sprint 1:

Participants:
Aleksandra Kalas
Dhir Shukla
Malhaar Kumar
Jovana Spasojevic 

Unfinished Tasks:
No unfinished tasks.

Practices to Continue:
A practice that we implemented during sprint1 that we found incredibly useful is having zoom meetings with the whole group present. This allowed us to quickly debug any issues and come up with ways to make our implementations of the design patterns even better. Along with this, it became much easier to keep up with what each of us was doing and were planning to do for the following days. 

New Practices to Implement:
As we had multiple meetings, sometimes it was difficult to coordinate which times worked for every group member. As a result sometimes we could only have certain group members on a call for less time than others. Hence a new practice we would like to implement for the next sprint to ensure even more organization and productivity is to have specific times for meeting on zoom. By having these times outlined beforehand we will all be able to plan the rest of our obligations around our zoom meetings.

Harmful Practices to Stop:
A harmful practice that we wish to improve on for the next sprint is to maximize our time that we have to work on the sprint. For sprint0 and sprint1 we started later on in the week and this caused some stress as we were working with very limited amounts of time when we had lots of documentation to go through along with the implementation of our code and navigating GitHub.

Best Experience:
Our best experience with this sprint was the actual implementation of the code itself. We found that this was not necessarily the easiest part but that it was the most rewarding as we got to learn about some new patterns to implement and that had the satisfaction of seeing these patterns in action. 

Worst Experience:
Our worst experience with this sprint was navigating GitHub. This proved to be a little troublesome as the majority of our group has only been using GitHub during this semester and some of the pulling and merging were causing us issues. However, we were quick to use resources available to us such as google, previous notes taken in class, and our mentor TA to assist us to correctly commit, push, pull, and merge the code we needed.
