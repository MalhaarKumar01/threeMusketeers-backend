DEV-21,Switch Sides,Jovana Spasojevic,https://github.com/UTMCSC207/assignment3-luckycharms_/pull/16, The overall code is good. You might just want to put a new line at the end of every file to make it look a bit better
DEV-21,Undo X Moves,Aleksandra Kalas,https://github.com/UTMCSC207/assignment3-luckycharms_/commit/95ae3d0e4d664c097ee81c5a04bce583f3ed566c,Look into the idea of changing the variable name for the purpose of it being a bit more eye appealing and easier to follow. Along with this remove some whitespace.
DEV-21,Switch Sides,Malhaar Kumar,https://github.com/UTMCSC207/assignment3-luckycharms_/pull/16,Adding specific letters to the getInputOption method to align with the rest of the code that has already been pushed to master.
DEV-21,Switch Sides,Aleksandra Kalas,https://github.com/UTMCSC207/assignment3-luckycharms_/pull/16,Some changes need to be made such as the names of some of the methods such as play_clone should be playClone. Along with this adding the other cases (X; N; P). Finally changing the protector of the restartGame method to be protected instead of private.
DEV-21, Probability of Winning, Malhaar Kumar, https://github.com/UTMCSC207/assignment3-luckycharms_/pull/17, Some changes were needed in the shortening of variable names and method calls; also removal of blank lines. The code was well written- with meaningful variable names making it easy to understand what was happening.
DEV-21, Undo X Moves, Dhir Shukla, https://github.com/UTMCSC207/assignment3-luckycharms_/pull/20, Overall code looks good. Check for whitespaces. Be careful with the use of break and continues
DEV-21, Restart, Aleksandra Kalas, https://github.com/UTMCSC207/assignment3-luckycharms_/pull/21, Double check that you have the correct terms for the correct classes. If using the Observer pattern there should be an interface and some class that implements that interface. Along with this there should be an Observable class and a class that extends it.
DEV-21, Restart, Malhaar Kumar, https://github.com/UTMCSC207/assignment3-luckycharms_/pull/21, Ensure that the pattern is implemented correctly and that all classes and interfaces have been made
