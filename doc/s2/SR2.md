(1) Participants in meeting: 
Aleksandra Kalas, Malhaar Kumar, Dhir Shukla, Jovana Spasojevic.


(2) Unfinished tasks: 
No unfinished tasks for this sprint.


(3) Good practices: 
A good practice that we have continued throughout this whole project which greatly helped us in this last sprint was having zoom calls. By having zoom calls we were quickly able to squash any confusion or miscommunication that was occurring. Zoom calls also allowed our group to be able to help each other with our code as we were able to screen share and show where we were having issues. 


(4) New practices: 
A new practice we would like to implement is prior to starting the project we would like to do as much research on the intended tasks. This would eliminate the confusion of not knowing where to start for a project, and it would eliminate any confusion about the content itself. 


(5) Harmful practices: 
A harmful practice that impacted the progression of this sprint is that all of our group members run on different schedules. While we actually had a group member in a different time zone, the group members in the same time zone still didn't run on the same schedules, with some being early birds and some being night owls. Despite this we were able to coordinate and work around each others schedules. 


(6) Best & Worst Experience: 
Our best experience was when we finalized all of our code and documentation. This gave us a sense of relief and we were able to feel confident for our presentation and demo. Our worst experience was with merging code to our master branch. While we got more comfortable with merging from the previous sprint, the thought of having some more issues with the merges was in the back of our heads.
